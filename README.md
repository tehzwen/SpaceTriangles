To successfully compile the project you will need to download threejs from https://threejs.org/, click the download link on the left and put the folder into the threejsgame folder under the name of "three.js-master".

Then use a terminal or powershell in the threejsgame folder and run python -m http.server then navigate to your browser and type localhost:8000 to view the project.

It's worth noting that the project runs alot smoother in Firefox as opposed to Chrome for my PC.

The game uses cinematic movies which sometimes won't play immediately due to browsers disallowing these. An easy fix we found is to open the videos folder in the game directory in your file explorer and refresh  the page a couple of times should you need.
